# Datadriveãƒ‡ã‚¹ã‚¯ãƒˆãƒƒãƒ—ç‰ˆ

This guide will help you get started with the **Glows.ai Datadrive Desktop App**, an extension of the **Datadrive** feature from the Glows.ai web platform.
It provides a more flexible cloud data management experience, enabling you to upload, download, and sync files between your local machine and the cloud more efficiently and reliably.

With the Datadrive Desktop App, you can easily browse, edit, and manage multiple Drives, and also import resources from external sources such as GitHub and Hugging Face, supporting faster project integration, deployment, and backup for individuals or teams.
