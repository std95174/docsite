# Uploading Custom Docker Images on Glows.ai

This tutorial will guide you step by step on how to upload a local Docker image to Glows.ai, covering image preparation, packaging, uploading, and instance creation.

## Creating a Docker Image Tar Package

To ensure your image runs properly on Glows.ai, pay attention to the following:

- The image **ENTRYPOINT** must keep running (otherwise the container will exit automatically).
- Install and start the SSH service (for convenient instance access).

### Setup Instructions

It is recommended to create a separate `.sh` script as the ENTRYPOINT, for example `run_glowsai.sh`, containing startup commands for the container (SSH service or custom services). Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Start SSH service
echo "Starting SSH service..."
/usr/sbin/sshd -E /root/.ssh/sshd_running.log

# Custom Command
echo "hello glowsai" > /hello.txt

# Keep the container running
echo "Container running..."
tail -f /dev/null
```

Also, in your Dockerfile, include SSH installation and configuration, and set the ENTRYPOINT:

```bash
# Install and configure SSH server
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server && \
    mkdir /var/run/sshd /root/.ssh && sed -ri 's/^#?PermitRootLogin\s+.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
    sed -ri 's/UsePAM yes/#UsePAM yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

# Copy and set permissions for the start script
COPY run_glowsai.sh /usr/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/run_glowsai.sh
EXPOSE 22
# Set entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/run_glowsai.sh"]
```

### Practical Steps

Before uploading your local image, ensure SSH is installed and running inside the image and that the ENTRYPOINT keeps running. Otherwise, follow these steps.

![set run_glowsai.sh](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/01.png)

1. Create a directory `new_images` and inside it, create `run_glowsai.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Start SSH service
echo "Starting SSH service..."
/usr/sbin/sshd -E /root/.ssh/sshd_running.log

# Custom Command
echo "hello glowsai" > /hello.txt

# Keep the container running
echo "Container running..."
tail -f /dev/null
```

> Note: The `# Custom Command` section is where you can add any commands to run on container startup. Do not modify other parts to avoid startup failure.

2. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```bash
# Set the base image
FROM oldwatch/tmp-images:huggingface-text-embeddings-inference_1_8

# Install and configure SSH server
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server && \
    mkdir /var/run/sshd /root/.ssh && sed -ri 's/^#?PermitRootLogin\s+.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
    sed -ri 's/UsePAM yes/#UsePAM yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

# Copy and set permissions for the start script
COPY run_glowsai.sh /usr/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/run_glowsai.sh
EXPOSE 22
# Set entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/run_glowsai.sh"]
```

3. Build the new image in the directory:

```bash
docker build -t new_images:huggingface-text-embeddings-inference_1_8 .
```

![Build successfully](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/02.png)

4. After a successful build, use `docker save` to package the image as a tar file:

```bash
docker save -o <output_file_path> <image_name_or_id>
```

![Pack tar ](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/03.png)

## Uploading the Docker Image Tar Package

1. Open Glows.ai’s **Images** interface and click `Upload Image`.
2. Enter an image description and click **Select Image** to upload the tar package.

![Choose image](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/04.png)

3. During upload, progress will be displayed. Once completed, the image can be used in Glows.ai.

![Upload successfully](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/05.png)

## Creating an Instance

1. When creating an instance, select **My Images**. You will see the uploaded image. Choose it, and if a Datadrive Mount is needed, complete the instance creation process.

![Create instance](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/06.png)

2. After the instance starts, manually set the ports you want to expose, e.g., SSH on port 22:

   - Click `New Port Forwarding`
   - Set **Service Port** to 22
   - **Do not check HTTPS**
   - Click `Create` to finish port forwarding

![Set port](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/07.png)

3. After about 10–20 seconds, port mapping will be established. The interface will show SSH connection info and password for local access.

![SSH connection](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/08.png)

4. If the instance runs other services that need public access, you can add additional port mappings. For HTTP services, check **HTTPS**.

![Public port](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/09.png)

5. For example, to run an HTTP service on port 8080, use the corresponding link from the instance interface to access it.

![Run an HTTP service](../docs-images/upload-docker-image/10.png)

6. After modifying the environment or files, you can create a **Snapshot** or release the instance when no longer needed.
